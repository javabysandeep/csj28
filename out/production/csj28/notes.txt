# variable and datatype
variable: it is a name given to a memory location address so it becomes easy to store access manipulate

    int age = 25;
    //age is variable
    //int datatype
    //25 is the value

# variables : To store data or access the data which is already stored
    # instance variable :
     why to use
     where they get the memory
     how many times they get the memory
     what are they?
        - instance variables are the variables which are defined at class and
            outside all class components
            i.e. outside of method, constructor, blocks, nested class
            without any static modifier

        - to store data which is object specific.
        - instance variables are stored inside the HEAP memory area
        - instance variables will get the memory every time object is created

    # static variable :
     why to use
     where they get the memory
     how many times they get the memory
     what are they?
             - static variables are the variables which are defined at class and
                 outside all class components
                 i.e. outside of method, constructor, blocks, nested class
                 with any static modifier

         - to store data which is common for all objects.
         - static variables are stored inside the class or method memory area
         - will be stored only once

# local variable :
     what are they?
         - local variables are the variables which are defined inside
                of method, constructor, blocks, method parameter
           with any static modifier
     why to use
     - to store data which is temporary calculations.
     - this data is not specific to common to all objects

     where they get the memory
     - local variables are stored inside the STACK memory area

     how many times they get the memory?
     - will be stored everytime method, block, constructor is called.

    whether local variables will get the default value?
        - local variables must be initialized before they are used otherwise CTE.
     - Local variables will not get default values. Developer is required to give initial or default value

    How to use local variables?
        - we define the variables inside the method/block/constructor
        - we use them inside the same method/block/constructor
        - we cannot access local variables outside
        - to access local variables we don't need any reference variable, ot class name
        - we access them directly


# methods :
    what:
        - it is a group of statements enclosed inside the curly braces
        - which has a name
        - which might accept input parameters ()
        - which might return some output values
        - even though method does not return anything it is mandatory to write void
        syntax:
            return_type nameOfMethod (input parameters) {
                //statements
            }
        e.g. 1. Method with no input no output
                 void m1(){}

        e.g. 2. Method with input no output
                void method(int number1){ }

        e.g. 3. Method with no input but returns output
                int method(){
                    return 1;
                 }

        e.g. 4. Method with  input and returns output
                int add(int number1, int number2){
                    return number1 + number2;
                 }

# Instance method:
    What - it is a method created at class level outside of constructor, block, methods without static modifier
       e.g.  int add(int number1, int number2){
                      return number1 + number2;
               }
    Why: to represent object specific behaviour/task
    How to access: we need reference variable to access instance method
    ** We cant define method inside another method/constructor/block

# static method:
    What - it is a method created at class level outside of constructor, block, methods
            with static modifier
       e.g.  static int add(int number1, int number2){
                      return number1 + number2;
               }
    Why: to represent behaviour/task common for all the objects
    How to access: we need class name to access static method

**** Non-static members [instance variable, instance method] cant be accessed from static method or static block









# constructors: To build objects
    default, zero, parameterized

# blocks : to maintain non-initialization activities of an object [ when & how many objects are created]
    instance, static

# nested class : To group multiple class which are logically doing same task.
    static, inner class, local inner class, anonymous class


// Constructor:
- why to use
    - we need constructors to create/build/construct the objects
    - object constructions is nothing but initialize the instance variables.
    - constructor is used to put some default value for object

- what is constructor?
    - it is a special method which has same name as of class name
    - this does not have any return type not even void
    - no access modifier [static, final, abstract, synchronized...]
    - constructor can accept the parameters[input]
        - zero parameterized constructor: if constructor does not accept any parameters
        - parmaterzied constructor: if constructor accepts the parameter
    * we can have a normal java method which has same name as of class name.

# Types of constructors
1. default constructor
    - it is a constructor provided by java compiler when developer does not provide any other constructor
    - default constructor does not accept any parameters and does not have any implementation
    - if developer provides any constructor then default constructor is not provided by java compiler

2. zero parameterized constructor
    - it does not accept any parameters
    - but we can write the implementation [body] inside the curly braces
    - it is provided by developer
    - e.g.
            class Student {
                Student() {

                }
            }

3. parameterized constructor
    - it does accept parameters
    - it is provided by developer
    - but we can write the implementation [body] inside the curly braces
    - e.g.
                class Student {
                    int id;
                    String name;

                    Student(int i, String s) {
                    // assigning local variables to the instance variables
                        id = i;
                        name = s;
                    }
                }

# how to access the constructor?
- at the time object creation we call constructors
    e.g.
        Student student = new Student();// call to the constructor
        Student student = new Student(1,"abc");// call to the param constructor

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Blocks: - group of statements enclosed inside the curly braces
- instance block:
    - what is it ?: it is a block of code enclosed inside the curly braces at class level without static keyword
    - syntax:
            class Demo {
                {
                    //instance block
                }
    - why to use instance block:
        - we use it to perform non-initialization activities such as maintaining no. of objects created, logging, auditing
    - when instance block will be executed?
        - every time object is created instance block will called

- static block:
    - what is it ?: it is a block of code enclosed inside the curly braces at class level with static keyword
            }
     - syntax:
           class Demo {
               static {
                    //static block
                }
            }
    - why to use static block: to perform one-time activity such as connecting to the database, server, loading the drivers
    - when static block will be executed?
        - it will be executed only once at the time of class loading

Q. Order of execution between instance block, static block, constructor
Ans. static block --> instance block --> constructor




# nested classes:
-what it is?
    - a class which is created inside another class

- types of nested classed:
    - static nested class
        - it is class defined inside another class with static modifier.
        - syntax:
                class A {
                    static class B {

                      }
              }
    - non-static nested class i.e. Inner class
         - it is class defined inside another class without static modifier.
        - syntax:
                class A {
                    // B is a Inner class
                     class B {

                      }
                }

    - Local Inner class
        - it is a class which is defined inside the method without static modifier
        - syntax :
            class Demo {

                PSVM(){
                    class Local {}

                }

            }
    - Anonymous class [abstract class and interface concept]


# OOPS
1. Encapsulation:
- what is it?
    - Encapsulation is a process of binding of data and methods which are acting on the data as a single unit.
    - Data + Method
- How to implement encapsulation?
    - we make data members private
    - we provide public methods for setting or getting the instance variables
    - getters and setters
- why do we need encapsulation?
    - we need encapsulation to protect the data
    - get better control on data
- drawbacks
    - lot of code
    -

#Inheritance
Q. what is inheritance?
   - It is a process of acquiring non-static, non-private & non-final members from one class to another class
   - inheritance represents IS-A type of relationship

Q. Why to use inheritance?
    - It is used for code usability purpose

Q. How to use Inheritance?
   - by using extends keyword
   - We define common data and methods in a class so that it can be reused. Such class is called as Parent/Super/Base
   - We create another class and use extends keyword along with the base class.
   e.g. // Base/Parent/Super class
        public class Loan {
            //common data
            int loadId;
            int loanAmount
            int rateOfInterest;
            int loanDuration;
            String borrowerName;

            // common methods
            void apply(){}
            void checkLoanEligibility(){}
            void calculateInterestPayment(){}

        }

        // Child/Sub/Derived class
        class PersonalLoan extends Loan {}

# Polymorphism:
- What it is?
    - It is an ability of an object to changes its behaviour either at compile time or run time.
    - Poly - many
    - morph - forms/methods/behaviour/task/function

-  How to achieve polymorphism?
    - We achieve polymorphism with the help of method overloading and method overriding

- Types of Polymorphism:
    - Compile time Polymorphism / static binding / early biding [Method overloading]
    - runtime time Polymorphism / dynamic binding / late biding [Method overriding]

- What is binding?
    - It is a process of deciding which method will be called at the time of execution

# What is method overloading?
- It is a process of defining multiple methods with
    - the same name
    - but different signature in the same class or in the child class
- In method overloading return type of the method will not be considered.

# can we overload final, static, private methods?
    - We can overload

# can we overload main method?
    - Yes we can

# can we overload constructor?
   - Yes we can

# What is method overriding?
- It is a process of defining a method in the child class with
    - same name
    - same return type
    - same signature
    - same or more relaxed access specifier
    as of parent class method.

- In method overriding  return type of the method will be considered.

# can we override final, static, private methods?
    - No.

# can we override main method?
    - No.

# can we override constructor?
   - No.

# Final keyword
- final keyword can be applied on variable, methods and classes
- final variable cant be reassigned the value
- final methods cannot be overriden
- final class cannot be extended.


# Immutable class:
- If a class is made immutable then its object state/content can't be changed once object is created.

- How to make immutable class?
    - We make class as final
    - make data members private
    - do not provide any public setters.

- String class and all other wrapper classes [Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Character, Float, Double, Boolean]
 are immutable classes.

# Abstraction :


# Array:
- what: it is a collection of homogenenous elements which are stored in continuous/sequential memory locations

- why : we use array to store multiple values of same type

- how to create an array
    - way 1: dataType [] arrayVariableName = new dataType[sizeOfArray];
    - way 2: dataType [] arrayVariableName = {values separated by comma};
    - way 3:
            - dataType [] arrayVariableName;
            - arrayVariableName = new dataType[sizeOfArray];

# How to access array elements?
- We access the array elements with the help of array index.
- array index starts from zero [why array index starts from zero]
- base address: it is where array's first element is stored.
- index: it is a measure of how far the element is from first element i.e. base address
- to calculate the memory location of any given element in the given array
     BASE_ADDRESS + DATA_TYPE_SIZE * INDEX;

-  int[] array = {1,2,3}; SOP(array[0])


# File Handling [java.io package]
1. File

- Byte Oriented Streams
2. InputStream
    - FileInputStream
    - BufferedInputStream
    - ObjectInputStream
3. OutputStream
    - FileOutputStream
    - BufferedOutputStream
    - ObjectOutputStream

- character oriented streams
1. Reader
    - FileReader
    - BufferedReader
2. Writer
    - FileWriter
    - BufferedWriter

# File
  - It represents physical files in java object format
  - With the help of file class we can
    - create new file
    - create new folder/directory
    - delete file
    - delete folder/directory
    - rename file
    - rename folder/directory
    - get the path of file/directory
        - relative
        - absolute
    - get the size/length of a file
    - can set the file/folder permissions
    - can get the file/folder permissions
    - check file or folder exists
    - check whether file is empty or not
    - can get or set the last modified time.
    - can get or set the created time.
    - list the file names in a given folder
    - list the file in a given folder
    - filter the files in a given folder
*** With File class we don't have methods for reading and writing purpose


-------------------------------------------------------
Read from a file directly in terms of bytes : FileInputStream
Write to a file directly in terms of bytes : FileOutputStream
Read from a buffer directly in terms of bytes : BufferedInputStream
Write to a buffer directly in terms of bytes : BufferedOutputStream


# Serialization : It is a process of writing java objects permanently on the file
# De-Serialization : It is a process of reading java object from the file
# To perform serialization or deserialization we have to implement Serialzable Interface
- Serialzable(I) : marker interface
NotSerializableException : will get this exception if we try to serailize an object which is not of ty

# Functional interfaces:
    - it is a java 8 feature
    - it is an interface which contains single abstract method
    - it can contain any number of default methods
    - it can contain any number of static methods
    - on functional interface we annotate the interface with @FunctionalInterface
    - @FunctionalInterface makes sure that interfaces has Single abstract method otherwise it gives compile time error
    e.g.
        @FunctionalInterface
        public interface I1 {
            int add(int number1, int number2);
        }

# Lambda Expression:
Q. why to use lambda expression?
- We use Lambda expression to implement functional interface only
- With the lambda we can write concise and short code
- Lambda expression reduces the code length

Q. What is a Lambda expression?
- It is an anonymous function which does not have
    - name
    - return type
    - access modifiers
  which is used to implement functional interface.

--------------------------------------------------------
Examples for Lambda Expressions:

1. Runnable runnable = () -> System.out.println("Hello, world!");


2. Function<Integer, Integer> square = (num) -> num * num;


3. BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> sum = (num1, num2) -> num1 + num2;


4. Predicate<String> isLong = (str) -> str.length() > 10;

5. List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        numbers.forEach((num) -> System.out.println(num));
