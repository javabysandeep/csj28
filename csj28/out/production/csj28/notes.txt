#Assignment : 28 Nov 2022 Monday
Step 1: Download and install git https://git-scm.com/downloads
Step 2: Create a account on github
Step 3: Open git software
Step 4: to copy the project from git to the local machine
		git clone URL[https://github.com/javabysandeep/csj28]
Step 5: Check the file changes in staging area
		git status
Step 6: Get the files update from remote : git pull

# Commands
git clone : copy the project from remote machine to local machine
git status: to check the files in staging area
git add: add the files from workspace to staging area
git commit: add file from staging to local repository
git push: add files from local to remote repo
git pull : get the file from remote repo to local repo
git fetch : get the file from local to workspace

# variable and datatype
variable: it is a name given to a memory location address so it becomes easy to store access manipulate

    int age = 25;
    //age is variable
    //int datatype
    //25 is the value

# variables : To store data or access the data which is already stored
    # instance variable :
     why to use
     where they get the memory
     how many times they get the memory
     what are they?
        - instance variables are the variables which are defined at class and
            outside all class components
            i.e. outside of method, constructor, blocks, nested class
            without any static modifier

        - to store data which is object specific.
        - instance variables are stored inside the HEAP memory area
        - instance variables will get the memory every time object is created

    # static variable :
     why to use
     where they get the memory
     how many times they get the memory
     what are they?
             - static variables are the variables which are defined at class and
                 outside all class components
                 i.e. outside of method, constructor, blocks, nested class
                 with any static modifier

         - to store data which is common for all objects.
         - static variables are stored inside the class or method memory area
         - will be stored only once

# local variable :
     what are they?
         - local variables are the variables which are defined inside
                of method, constructor, blocks, method parameter
           with any static modifier
     why to use
     - to store data which is temporary calculations.
     - this data is not specific to common to all objects

     where they get the memory
     - local variables are stored inside the STACK memory area

     how many times they get the memory?
     - will be stored everytime method, block, constructor is called.

    whether local variables will get the default value?
        - local variables must be initialized before they are used otherwise CTE.
     - Local variables will not get default values. Developer is required to give initial or default value

    How to use local variables?
        - we define the variables inside the method/block/constructor
        - we use them inside the same method/block/constructor
        - we cannot access local variables outside
        - to access local variables we don't need any reference variable, ot class name
        - we access them directly


# methods :
    what:
        - it is a group of statements enclosed inside the curly braces
        - which has a name
        - which might accept input parameters ()
        - which might return some output values
        - even though method does not return anything it is mandatory to write void
        syntax:
            return_type nameOfMethod (input parameters) {
                //statements
            }
        e.g. 1. Method with no input no output
                 void m1(){}

        e.g. 2. Method with input no output
                void method(int number1){ }

        e.g. 3. Method with no input but returns output
                int method(){
                    return 1;
                 }

        e.g. 4. Method with  input and returns output
                int add(int number1, int number2){
                    return number1 + number2;
                 }

# Instance method:
    What - it is a method created at class level outside of constructor, block, methods without static modifier
       e.g.  int add(int number1, int number2){
                      return number1 + number2;
               }
    Why: to represent object specific behaviour/task
    How to access: we need reference variable to access instance method
    ** We cant define method inside another method/constructor/block

# static method:
    What - it is a method created at class level outside of constructor, block, methods
            with static modifier
       e.g.  static int add(int number1, int number2){
                      return number1 + number2;
               }
    Why: to represent behaviour/task common for all the objects
    How to access: we need class name to access static method










# constructors: To build objects
    default, zero, parameterized

# blocks : to maintain non-initialization activities of an object [ when & how many objects are created]
    instance, static

# nested class : To group multiple class which are logically doing same task.
    static, inner class, local inner class, anonymous class
